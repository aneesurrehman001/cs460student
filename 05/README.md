CS460 Assignment 5: Transformations!

Stuff is being taken from slides and assignment5 document!!!!

Extra credit Part 3 answer is in weird format in pdf file!!!

Part3 a) Three.js used indexed geometry ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER? and XTK doesn't use the indexed geometry. 
      b) Three.js shaders code is way longer than XTK shaders code.
      c) this is how the transformation is passed ? --> uniformMatrix4fv: WebGLUniformLocation - ID: 1, false,[..(16)..]
